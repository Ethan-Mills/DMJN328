\section*{Course Description}
This course builds on material in DMJN208, developing studentsâ€™ facility with quantitative research methods used in journalism and media research. Students learn to work with and critically assess quantitative information, with a particular emphasis on polls and scientific studies. The course covers basic and intermediate statistical concepts and calculations. Potential topics include survey research design and interpretation, causation, the central limit theorem, standard error, statistical significance and confidence intervals.

\subsection*{Pep Talk}
Learning R can be tough; Lord knows I struggled to learn it. But learning anything is always hard. But when you have really learned it. Wow, there is no better feeling in the world.  And once you have learned even just a few basic things in R you - and others - will be absolutely amazed at what you can accomplish.

One of the leaders in developing R, Hadley Wickham, had this to say about frustration and learning to code and R: 

\begin{quote}
 It's easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, ''Oh it's me, I'm really stupid,'' or, ''I'm not made out to program.'' But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It's just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don't blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.
\end{quote}

There will be moments where you want to bash your head against the desk.  Don't. Ask me for help any way (e.g. personally, e-mail, mylearningspace). Take a break. Walk around. Go get a drink. Watch cat videos on YouTube for a few minutes then just come back and take a break.

You. can. do. this...

And when you're done, you will be blown away....

\subsection*{Learning Outcomes}
At the end of this course will be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item understand basic principles of data visualization
\item import successfully a variety of datasets into R
\item to manipulate different types of variables found in modern datasets in R
\item to produce and modify basic charts and graphs in R
\item understand basic statistical concepts such as measures of central tendency, variation and inference. 
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Course Readings}
Please purchase 
\fullcite{healy_data_2018} and \fullcite{stray_curious_2016} (available as a coursepack in the bookstore)
\section*{Software Requirements}
We will be using three different software packages in this course: R, RStudio and GitHub Desktop. Each of these software packages will be installed for your use on all the computers in OD211. At a basic level, you should be able to complete the course without bringing any personal technology. However, you may find it useful to install this software on your personal computer so that you can work on the course material at your own pace. 

\subsection*{R}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Visit \url{https://cran.r-project.org/index.html}
\item Select Download R for (Mac) OS X or Download R for Windows
\item Select the latest package of R for download and install as you would any regular software. For macs, this involves double-clicking the .pkg file that is downloaded and walking through the steps in the dialogue menu. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{RStudio }

\begin{enumerate}
\item Visit \url{https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/}
\item Select the Free Desktop version; it should direct you to a download screen appropriate to your operating system. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{GitHub Desktop}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Visit \url{https://desktop.github.com/}
\item Select Download for MacOs or Download for Windows (as appropriate)
\item Install
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Descriptions}
\subsubsection*{News Data Journalism Visualization Presentation}
In this assignment students will present a recent example of some kind of data visualization for a news media outlet, either online or in print. Student will present the data visualization to the class and discuss it with the class (pass/fail). 

\subsubsection*{Graph of Data}
In this assignment, students will present one original graph of some kind of data that they find newsworthy. Part of the assignment will include finding the data, importing it into R, manipulating it fairly and as necessary and producing a compelling, attractive graph that communicates a newsworthy pattern. 

\subsubsection*{Map}
In this assignment, students will present one original map of some kind kind of data that they find newsworthy. Part of the assignment will include finding the data, importing it into R, manipulating it fairly and as necessary and producing a compelling, attractive map that communicates a newsworthy patterns. 

\subsubsection*{Final Exam}
A final exam will be conducted that covers basic statistical concepts covered in the course and the text \textcite{stray_curious_2016} (see Course Readings).

\section*{Late Submissions}

\section*{Academic Integrity}
Wilfrid Laurier University uses software that can check for plagiarism. if requested to do so by the instructor, students are required to submit their written work in electronic form and have it checked for plagiarism.

Laurier is committed to a culture of integrity within and beyond the classroom.
